BioMME is an application that is meant to streamline building biological computational models. It is an all-in-one tool that allows the user to build a model, solve for its mathematical equations, and plot all relevant features. This is an achived version of the app with full functionality (newest version is being created and optimized for licensing at the Medical College of Wisconsin).
